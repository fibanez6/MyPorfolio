# Docker for Frontend Developers

Docker has revolutionized how we develop, deploy, and distribute applications. As a frontend developer, understanding Docker can significantly improve your workflow.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.

## Benefits for Frontend Development

### Consistent Development Environment

No more "it works on my machine" issues:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Easy Environment Setup

New team members can get started quickly:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Production Parity

Development environment matches production exactly.

## Dockerfile for React Apps

Here's a optimized Dockerfile for React applications:

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for production
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

## Docker Compose for Full Stack

Orchestrate multiple services:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  frontend:
    build: .
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    environment:
      - REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

  api:
    image: node:18-alpine
    working_dir: /api
    ports:
      - '5000:5000'
    volumes:
      - ./api:/api
    command: npm start

  database:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
```

## Development Workflow

### Hot Reloading in Docker

Enable hot reloading for development:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Volume Mounting

Mount source code for live updates:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/app -p 3000:3000 my-react-app
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use .dockerignore**: Exclude unnecessary files
2. **Multi-stage builds**: Reduce production image size
3. **Specific base images**: Use alpine variants when possible
4. **Cache dependencies**: Copy package.json first
5. **Non-root user**: Run containers as non-root for security

## Conclusion

Docker transforms frontend development by providing consistent environments, easy deployment, and better collaboration. Start with simple containers and gradually adopt more advanced patterns.
