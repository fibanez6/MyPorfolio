# Introduction to Machine Learning with Python

Python has become the go-to language for machine learning thanks to its simplicity and powerful libraries. This guide will get you started.

## Essential Libraries

The Python ML ecosystem includes several key libraries:

- **NumPy**: Numerical computing foundation
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization

## Your First ML Model

Here's a simple example using scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load and split your data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Common ML Tasks

- **Classification**: Predicting categories
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values
- **Clustering**: Finding hidden patterns
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Simplifying data

## Conclusion

Python makes machine learning accessible to developers of all backgrounds. Start with simple projects and gradually tackle more complex problems.
